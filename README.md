### What is Winside
Winside is an app for Windows, powered by Electron, that allows practically any web content to be turned into a useful native-feeling sidebar.
Winside uses applets called [Winserts](https://github.com/Spatchy/Winserts) to load pages and modify them with custom JavaScript and CSS so they're perfect for viewing and using in a sidebar formfactor. Winside also provides a useful API to unlock more power from your favourite online services.

### What can it do?
Winside is curently in developer preview and isn't quite ready for general use just yet. Right now, it can open a sidebar from a url shortcut, injust custom scripts and stylesheets and there's a settings menu that shows hints of what Winside will be able to do very soon. From its first general public release, Winside will have a useful and well-documented API and a library of useful Winserts in the official repository to allow anyone to view content at a glance and use useful tools right from a powerful pop-out sidebar.
