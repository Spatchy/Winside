### What is Winside
Winside is an app for Windows that allows practically any web content to be turned into a useful native-feeling sidebar.
Winside uses applets called [Winserts](https://github.com/Spatchy/Winserts) to load pages and modify them with custom JavaScript and CSS so they're perfect for viewing and using in a sidebar formfactor. Winside also provides a useful API to unlock more power from your favourite online services.

### What can it do?
Winside is now available to anyone with Windows 10 or 11! Once a Winsert is installed, you can open its sidebar from a shortcut and use it whenever you like, no switching browser windows required! Winside's ability to inject custom scripts and stylesheets into any website mean Winside's sidebars have extra powers compared to their regular browser-based versions, all handled through Winside's permission system.

If you have any basic web development experience (or even if you just want to learn!), creating your own Winsert is relatively easy. Winside has a useful and well-documented API and a growing collection of development tools so you can create your ideal sidebar! Be sure to take a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/Spatchy/Winside/wiki) for more information and to see the developer guide!
